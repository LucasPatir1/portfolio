            I am a professional graduated from Polit√©cnico Grancolombiano
            University and for the past eight years, I've been immersed in the
            dynamic world of video editing, working with "Noticias Caracol",
            which is not only the most-watched newcast in Colombia but also has
            alliances with several countries worldwide.
          </p>

          <p className="text-md md:text-lg text-gray-300 max-x-md text-justify">
            This experience has given me incredible opportunities to collaborate
            with diverse teams and shoulder substantial responsibilities. As the
            last line of defense before content went live, I honed my skills in
            working effectively with large teams and ensuring top-notch results.
